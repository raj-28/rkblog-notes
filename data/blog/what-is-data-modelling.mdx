## What is Data modelling ?

Data modeling is the process of creating a structured representation of a system's data and relationships. It helps organizations understand and organize their data in a way that is intuitive, efficient, and scalable.

Data models are used to design databases and specify how data should be stored, organized, and accessed. They can be conceptual, logical, or physical, depending on the level of detail and the intended use.

> Data modeling is an important part of the database design process, as it helps organizations ensure that their data is structured in a way that meets their needs and enables them to make informed decisions. It is also critical for maintaining data integrity and accuracy, as well as ensuring that the data can be easily accessed and analyzed.
