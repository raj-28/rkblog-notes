## What is What is data sparsity?

- Data sparsity refers to the phenomenon of having a large number of empty or zero values in a dataset. 

- Data sparsity can occur when a dataset is very large, or when it represents a population with a large number of possible values or combinations of values.

- Data sparsity can be a problem for certain types of analyses, because it can make it more difficult to draw conclusions from the data.

> To address data sparsity, data analysts may need to use techniques such as data imputation, which involves filling in missing values with estimates based on the available data.
