## Various design schema in data modelling

In data modeling, a schema is a structure or blueprint that describes the organization of data. There are two main design schemas that can be used in data modeling, each with its own set of characteristics and advantages:

- **Star schema**: A star schema consists of a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables. The fact table contains measures or facts about a particular business process, while the dimension tables contain attributes or characteristics that describe the measures. The star schema is simple and easy to understand, making it a popular choice for data warehouses and business intelligence systems.

- **Snowflake schema**: A snowflake schema is similar to a star schema, but the dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables. This can help reduce data redundancy and improve the flexibility of the schema, but can also make it more complex and harder to understand.
