## What is RDBMS?

- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System

- It is a type of database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model, a way of organizing data using tables and relationships between them.

- In a relational database, data is stored in tables, with each table consisting of rows (also known as records) and columns (also known as fields). Each row represents a unique entity, such as a customer or an order, and each column represents a piece of information about that entity, such as the customer's name or the order's total cost.

- Tables can be related to each other through the use of keys. A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. This allows tables to be linked together in a logical way, allowing data to be queried and retrieved from multiple tables at once.

- RDBMSs are typically used to store and manage large amounts of structured data, such as customer and order information for an e-commerce website. They are widely used in business and other organizations due to their reliability, flexibility, and ability to handle large amounts of data.

>  Examples of RDBMSs include Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. These provide a set of tools and interfaces for creating and managing databases, as well as a programming language (such as SQL) for querying and manipulating data.
