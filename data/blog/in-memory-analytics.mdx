## What is In-Memory Analytics?

In-memory analytics refers to the use of computer memory (RAM) to store and process data for analysis, rather than reading and writing data from a slower storage medium such as a hard drive(HDD) or solid-state drive(SSD). 
In-memory analytics can be used to perform real-time analysis on large volumes of data, and it can provide faster results than traditional disk-based analytics.

## Where it is used?

In-memory analytics is often used in situations where speed is important, such as in financial trading, e-commerce, and real-time data processing. 
It can also be useful for analyzing data that needs to be updated frequently, because it allows data to be processed and analyzed as soon as it is received.

## Advantages of in-memory analytics

Advantages of in-memory analytics is that it can be much faster than disk-based analytics, because data can be accessed directly from memory rather than being read from a slower storage device. 
In-memory analytics can also be more scalable than disk-based analytics, because it is easier to add more memory to a system than it is to add more storage.

## Limitations of in-memory analytics

In-memory analytics can also be more expensive than disk-based analytics, because it requires a larger amount of memory to store the data. Also, in-memory analytics is not suitable for storing very large datasets that cannot fit into memory, because the data will have to be paged out to storage, which can slow down the analysis.
