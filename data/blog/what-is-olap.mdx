## What is OLAP?

- OLAP stands for On-Line Analytical Processing

- It is a type of database system that is optimized for data analysis and reporting.

- It is used to support business intelligence and decision-making activities by providing fast access to summarized data from multiple sources.

- OLAP systems are designed to handle large volumes of data and to allow users to easily analyze data from different perspectives. 

- OLAP use a multi-dimensional data model, which represents data as a set of dimensions (such as time, geography, and product) and measures (such as sales, profit, and quantity).
