# Various Types of Data Models

There are mainly three different types of data models:

- **Conceptual data models** describe the overall structure and organization of a system's data, without going into too much detail. They help stakeholders understand the big picture and identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the data.

- **Logical data models**, on the other hand, provide a more detailed view of the data and its relationships. They are used to design the database schema and ensure that the data is structured in a way that is efficient and easy to use.

- **Physical data models**, also known as database models, are used to implement the logical model in a specific database management system (DBMS). They take into account the specifics of the DBMS and the hardware it will be running on, and specify how the data should be organized and stored. (This data model describes how the system will be implemented using a specific DBMS system.)

> Three main types of data models: conceptual, logical, and physical.

> Conceptual data model defines what should the system contain.

> Logical data model defines how the system should be implemented regardless of the DBMS.

> Physical data model defines how the system should be implemented using a specific DBMS.
