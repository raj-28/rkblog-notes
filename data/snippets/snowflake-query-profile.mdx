## Snowflake Query Profile

- Snowflake Query Profile is a tool that provides detailed information about the execution of a Snowflake SQL query.
- It includes a visual representation of the query plan, which shows the "operators" or "nodes" that process rows of data and the "links" that pass data between them.
- The Query Profile also displays execution details and statistics for each node and the overall query.
- It can be used to diagnose poor query performance, understand why a query is still running, or identify issues that may have resulted in unexpected query results.
- The Query Profile can be accessed in the Snowflake UI by clicking on a query in the query editor or query history, or by using a URL template with the query's ID.

Snowflake is working on a feature that will allow users to query the data shown in the Query Profile.
