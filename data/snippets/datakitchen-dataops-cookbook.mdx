## Chapter 2: Eight Challenges of Data Analytics

- The role of data analytics in driving business growth and the challenges that data analytics teams often face in meeting the expectations of their business partners. 
-  Frequent challenges include limited resources, development cycles, and IT systems that can be a source of conflict and frustration, leading to dissatisfaction and preventing the team from achieving its full potential. 

It is super important to understand and address the challenges in order to maximize the team's performance.

### Challenge 1: The Goalpost keeps moving

- Users of data analytics often have constantly changing requirements and expect immediate responses to their requests. 
- However, they may not know exactly what insights they need or what they will need in the future, as they are not data experts. 
- They also need answers as soon as possible in order to take advantage of business opportunities before they close. 
- Providing analytics to stakeholders may also generate more questions and drive demand for new analytics, but this can be difficult to meet if the delivery of new analytics cannot meet required time frames.
- This can lead to conflicts and frustrations between the analytics team and the users.

### Challenge 2: Data Lives in Silos

- Companies often collect a large amount of data from various sources and systems, which can be challenging to integrate due to the wide range of skills and technologies required. 
- The data analytics team must work with IT to access this data and implement changes in order to develop new analytics, but this process can be complex and time-consuming, leading to delays in meeting the expectations of business stakeholders who want fast answers.

### Challenge 3: Data Formats are not Optimized

- Data in operational systems is often not structured in a way that allows for the efficient creation of analytics. 
- This is because the schema of these systems is optimized for real-time inserts, updates, and display in a web user interface, rather than for reading and aggregating data for analytics purposes. 
- In contrast, an analytics database is structured to optimize these activities and to be easily understood by humans, with field names that describe their contents and data tables linked in a logical manner.

### Challenge 4: Data Errors

- Errors in data can prevent the data pipeline from functioning correctly and can be difficult to identify and fix. 
- These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, such as an algorithm not performing as expected, a database schema change, or an IT failure. 
- Data errors may include duplicate records or incorrect data in individual fields. 
- Resolving data errors can be time-consuming and challenging.

### Challenge 5: Bad Data Ruins Good Reports

- If data errors are not detected and corrected before they are published in analytics, they can lead to frustration among internal stakeholders and divert key team members from important projects. 
- Bad data can also damage the credibility of the data analytics team, as business colleagues may lose trust in the accuracy of their work if they see errors in reports consistently.
- This can lead to a loss of value for the work of the data analytics team.

### Challenge 6: Data Pipeline Maintenance Never Ends

- The data analytics process involves a series of operations that aim to produce consistent, high-quality output.
- However, every change or update to the data sources, schemas, analytics, or other aspects of the pipeline requires careful attention to ensure that it does not break operational analytics. 
- Validating and verifying these changes can be time-consuming, and the data analytics team may spend a significant portion of their time maintaining and improving the quality of the data pipeline. 
- This work is necessary but may not be visible to business customers, who may not appreciate the effort that goes into meeting their requests for new analytics.

### Challenge 7: Manual Process Fatigue

- The data analytics team is responsible for integrating, cleansing, transforming, and deploying new analytics on a consistent basis. 
- While some of these tasks may be automated, others may require manual processes that can be error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious. 
- These manual procedures can also lead to high employee turnover and strain the productivity of the data team. 
- Many managers have seen high-performing team members become overwhelmed and burn out due to the repetitive nature of manual data procedures.

### Challenge 8: The Trap of “Hope and Heroism”

- Many CDOs and data analytics professionals struggle with their roles and face challenges such as changing requirements, slipped schedules, and low confidence in analytics insights.
- These challenges can lead to **heroism**, where data analytics teams work long hours to meet expectations but are not able to sustain this approach over time.
- They may also resort to **hope**, where they quickly produce solutions without thorough testing and hope they do not break, which carries risks.
- They may adopt a **cautious** approach, delivering higher quality but fewer features to users, which may not meet their delivery requirements or be viewed as inefficient.
- These approaches do not adequately address the needs of both users and data analytics professionals.
