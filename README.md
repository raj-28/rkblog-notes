## Welcome to Pramit's Blogs & Notes!

In this blog, you'll find a collection of my personal experience, my journey and notes on a variety of topics that interest me. But that's not all! I'm also excited to delve into the world of #DataOps, #databases, #datawarehousing, and #bigdata. And for those interested in the basics of data science and AI/ML, I've got you covered too. My blogs and notes(personal sketches) cover a range of tech-related topics that I'm passionate about and I can't wait to share them with you.
